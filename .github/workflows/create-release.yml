# + creates a new release branch from develop,
# + raises version numbers semantically,
# + merges the release branch into main,
# + sets a version tag,
# + generates release notes from commits and contributors,
# + creates a support branch off the last release if necessary
# + and publishes a NuGet.
#
# This workflow must be triggered manually.
